# Personal Blog

> [!WARNING]  
> **This repository is no longer actively maintained.** I’ve rebuilt my [website](www.vladsiv.com) using Next.js, and this version is now deprecated.

I've started this site as an experiment, mainly to practice putting my work 
into plain language that readers of all fields could understand, but also as 
a chance to meet and connect with like-minded people.

Most of the articles here are related to data and 
programming but my plan is to occasionally write 
about the implementation of modern data solutions in 
scientific research.

This repository contains the source code of the blog. It's implemented using 
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and 
[minimal-mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) theme, which 
I extended to include light-dark theme switch.

I hope you will enjoy your stay and don't forget to grab 
a :coffee: before you start reading!
