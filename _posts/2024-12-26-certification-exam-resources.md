## Purpose

Over the past few years, I've completed several certification exams in data
engineering, machine learning, and cloud infrastructure. While my main
goal was to build new skills and advance my career, I have to admit - I also
did it for fun.

Sometimes I miss the academia - the learning, the sense of progress, and even
the late nights spent figuring things out. Studying for certification exams
brings back a bit of that feeling. It reminds me of the good times in college - 
when diving into new topics felt rewarding and full of possibility, and the
focus was on understanding and curiosity. It's a nice contrast to the way
things often work in the tech industry.

I've been meaning to put together a blog post that collects all the useful
resources I've gathered over time. My study notes and links to helpful
materials have ended up scattered across this blog and local files, and it
feels like it's time to bring everything into one central place. This way,
it's easier to manage and reference - both for myself and anyone else who
might find it helpful.

If you know of any great resources I might have missed, feel free to contribute
by opening a PR on GitHub
[repo](https://github.com/VladimirSiv/VladimirSiv.github.io){:target="\_blank"}
of this blog or by sending me an email. I'd love to make this collection as
comprehensive and useful as possible!
