## Introduction

Throughout my studies I was involved in several science projects that used 
large clusters for numerical analysis. One of them used the
[**S**panish **I**nitiative for **E**lectronic **S**imulations with **T**housands of **A**toms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIESTA_(computer_program)){:target="_blank"} (SIESTA) program which performs efficient electronic structure calculations 
and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations of molecules and solids. SIESTA 
is written in Fortran95 and offers highly efficient parallelization.

This wasn't the first time that I came across Fortran but it was definitely 
the first time I realized how powerful Fortran is for parallelization 
and numerical analysis.

Fortran first appeared in 1957 and if you come from the industry, it may be 
hard to wrap your head around the fact that it's still used in 2022. Moreover, 
Fortran is still a dominant language for things like hydrodynamics, large scale 
molecular dynamics, electronic structure calculations, large scale climate 
models etc.

To quote Charles Anthony Richard Hoare[^1]:
> “I don’t know what the programming language of the year 2000 will look like, 
> but I know it will be called FORTRAN.” - circa 1982

[^1]: [Tony_Hoare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Hoare){:target="_blank"}

Of course, things have changed, but for large scale simulation of physical 
systems, Fortran still stays strong and there are many reasons why that is the 
case:
- [Why physicists still use Fortran](https://www.moreisdifferent.com/2015/07/16/why-physicsts-still-use-fortran/){:target="_blank"}
- [ArsTechnica - Scientific computing’s future: Can any coding language top a 1950s behemoth?](https://arstechnica.com/science/2014/05/scientific-computings-future-can-any-coding-language-top-a-1950s-behemoth/){:target="_blank"}

The aim of this article is to give a brief introduction to parallelization using 
Fortran by introducing and explaining concepts on a high level. Additionally, 
you can use the [Local Setup](#local-setup) to build a docker image and quickly 
experiment with some code and [Examples](#examples).

## Partitioned Global Address Space

### Concept

When we think about parallel processing the first thing that pops up in our 
mind is multiple independent processes that access data and also communicate 
with each other.

We can roughly divide types of interactions based on the mechanism by 
which parallel processes are able to communicate with each other:

- **Shared Memory** - In this model, parallel processes share a global memory which 
they can asynchronously access to read and write data. This, of course, brings 
some specific difficulties such as 
[race conditions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_condition){:target="_blank"} 
which give rise to the concept of 
[locks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock_(computer_science)){:target="_blank"} 
that control the access and so on.
- **Message Passing** - In the message-passing model, parallel processes do not 
share memory. All data is local to the process. They use messages between 
each other to exchange the data. This exchange can be synchronous or 
asynchronous between a sender and a receiver depending on the implementation.
- **Partitioned Global Address Space** - PGAS is something in between, a global 
space is partitioned so that each process has a local data but also access to 
the shared memory which allows exchange of data between different parallel 
processes.  

The following picture perfectly illustrates the differences between these 
models:

{% include image.html
    src="/assets/images/posts/coarrays-fortran/memory-models.png"
    alt="memory-models"
    caption="Image Source: Partitioned Global Address Space Languages Paper [1] - 
    See Resources Section"
%}

Conceptually, the partitioned-memory model can be imagined as a single shared 
memory which is partitioned at the hardware level. Think of several memories 
that are interconnected to build one shared space. This sharing can be 
implemented in multiple ways, for example if we have clusters of racks, the 
shared space can be managed using network devices or through cache coherence. 
On the other hand, each processor has attached storage that is considered 
local, but can also be a part of the global shared space.

In such a structure, different parts of the shared memory have different 
access latencies. That's why PGAS distinguishes between local and remote data 
access.

### Languages

There are multiple programming languages that implement the PGAS model, such 
as:
- [Unified Parallel C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Parallel_C){:target="_blank"} - 
is an extension of C programming language designed for high-performance computing 
on large-scale parallel machines. It extends the concept of arrays and pointers 
so they can be shared between processors
- [Split-C](http://now.cs.berkeley.edu/split-c_parallel_programming.html){:target="_blank"} - 
is a parallel-extension of C programming language that acknowledges the latency 
of remote access by allowing split-phase, or non-blocking, transactions. If you 
want to learn more, please see: 
[Parallel Programming in Split-C](http://now.cs.berkeley.edu/split-c_parallel_programming.html){:target="_blank"}
- [X10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X10_(programming_language)){:target="_blank"} - 
is described as a modern object-oriented programming language providing an 
asynchronous PGAS programming model
- [Chapel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapel_(programming_language)){:target="_blank"} - 
allows object-oriented concepts and generic programming. It supports both task 
and data-driven parallelism while enabling separation of algorithm and data 
structure details.

Where is Fortran in all of this?

Well, if we are mentioning the history of PGAS languages, we have to bring up 
the fact that Fortran was at the forefront of PGAS development and implementation.

In 1993, an extension of Fortran90 with constructs that support parallel 
computing emerged and was called 
[High Performance Fortran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Performance_Fortran){:target="_blank"}. 
HPF has some characteristics of PGAS-like languages but was never explicitly 
described as a PGAS language since it was released even before the term *PGAS* 
existed [\[1\]](#resource-1). The idea behind HPF is that it's a 
data-parallel language for distributed parallel computers. It unified the 
concepts of older languages, such as:
- **FortranD** (1988) - 
[Fortran D Language Specification](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2391612_Fortran_D_Language_Specification){:target="_blank"}
- **Vienna Fortran** (1988) - 
[A Fortran Language Extension for Distributed Memory Multiprocessors](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/B978044488712250007X){:target="_blank"}
- **CM Fortran** (1991) - PDF: [CM Fortran Programming Guide - Thinking Machines Corporation](https://www.sthmuseum.org/downloads/CM5/CMFortran_ProgrammingGuide.pdf){:target="_blank"}

> If you are interested in the history of High Performance Fortran, read the 
> following paper:
> [The rise and fall of High Performance Fortran: an historical object lesson](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1238844.1238851){:target="_blank"}

After HPF came along 
[Co-Array Fortran (CAF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coarray_Fortran){:target="_blank"} 
which is a parallel extension of Fortran95 that adds the coarray object as a new 
concept to the language. The original paper that introduced the coarray was 
published in 1998: 
[Co-array Fortran for parallel programming](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/289918.289920){:target="_blank"}. 
But the extension was formally introduced to the Fortran Standard in 2008 after 
WG5 committee's review: 
[Co-arrays in the next Fortran Standard](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1080399.1080400){:target="_blank"}.

## Coarray Fortran

There are two main concepts in Coarray Fortran:

### Image

An image is a parallel process that is executed independently. Each images is 
basically a copy of a program and has its own local memory. In other words, 
images follow 
[Single Program, Multiple Data (SPMD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_program,_multiple_data){:target="_blank"} 
model. The logic within a single program determines the workload for each 
image, as you will see in the [Examples](#examples) section.

Execution of images is independent i.e. each image runs on its own in parallel 
to the other images. However, there are cases when one process depends on the 
result of another and if we are doing them in parallel i.e. on different 
images, we have to have a way to tell one image to way for the other. That 
process is called **synchronization**.

The process of synchronization is described in detail in the section below: 
[Synchronization](#synchronization).

### Coarray

The concept of the coarray may be confusing. Even though it has the word 
*array* in it, we can also define a *scalar* coarray:

```fortran
integer :: i[*]
```

or alternatively:

```fortran
integer, codimension[*] :: i
```

The idea here is that each image will have a copy of the variable `i` but the 
codimension defines where the value belongs i.e. on which image. The asterisk 
`*` is important since it dynamically takes the number of images as a value.

To illustrate, let's say that we have a coarray that's also an array:

```fortran
integer :: i(2)[*]
```

If we use 3 images, this will allocate 6 elements which form the coarray `i`.

{% include image.html
    src="/assets/images/posts/coarrays-fortran/fortran-coarray.jpg"
    alt="similarity-header"
    caption="Coarray depiction"
%}

Using `i(1)` will reference different elements in the coarray depending on 
which image we execute it. However, if we use `i[1](1)` on image 2, we are 
specifying the codimension and that will actually take the value which is not 
local to the image 2 i.e. it will access remote data on the image 1.

Take a look at examples [Read from an image](#read-from-an-image) and 
[Swapping values between images](#swapping-values-between-images) to 
get a better idea of how it works in action.


## Local Setup

To experiment with coarrays we need a coarray-capable compiler. 
[The GNU Fortran](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gfortran/){:target="_blank"} 
compiler supports coarrays through the 
[OpenCoarrays](http://www.opencoarrays.org/){:target="_blank"} 
project.

> OpenCoarrays is an open-source software project that produces an application 
> binary interface (ABI) used by the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) Fortran 
> front-end to build executable programs that leverage the parallel programming 
> features of Fortran 2018.

The OpenCoarrays enables `gfortran` to support Fortran's parallel programming 
features without making direct reference to the back-end communication 
library. In other words, we can specify other underlying communication 
libraries without costly refactoring. 

The local setup depends on your machine and OS. I'm running Arch-based 
distribution (Manjaro) and I had some issues with libraries. So, to make things 
easier for everyone I've made a simple bash script, for Debian-based 
distributions, that installs everything that we need in order to run 
Coarray Fortran: 

```bash
# installation.sh
apt update
apt-get -y install \
	software-properties-common \
	build-essential \
	curl \
	wget \
	git \
	gcc \
	lsb-release \
	libmpich-dev \
	libcoarrays-mpich-dev \
	libopenmpi-dev \
	libcoarrays-openmpi-dev \
	libcoarrays-dev

# Install latest cmake
wget -O - https://apt.kitware.com/keys/kitware-archive-latest.asc 2>/dev/null | gpg --dearmor - | tee /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/kitware.gpg >/dev/null
apt-add-repository 'deb https://apt.kitware.com/ubuntu/ focal mmain'
apt update
apt install -y cmake

# Install OpenCoarrays
cd /opt 
git clone https://github.com/sourceryinstitute/OpenCoarrays.git
cd OpenCoarrays
mkdir opencoarrays-build
cd opencoarrays-build
export FC=/usr/bin/gfortran
export CC=/usr/bin/gcc
cmake /opt/OpenCoarrays -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/OpenCoarrays/opencoarrays-install
make
make install
ln -s /opt/OpenCoarrays/opencoarrays-install/bin/caf /usr/local/bin/caf
ln -s /opt/OpenCoarrays/opencoarrays-install/bin/cafrun /usr/local/bin/cafrun
```

You can use this script to build a docker image:

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:focal
ARG DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive
ARG TZ=Europe/London

COPY ./installation.sh .
RUN chmod +x ./installation.sh
RUN ./installation.sh

RUN useradd -ms /bin/bash coarray
USER coarray
WORKDIR /home/coarray
```

Running this image allows us to easily experiment with coarrays using the 
following commands:
- `caf` - for compiling. Example: `caf test.f90 -o program`, where `program` is 
the name of the output.
- `cafrun` - for running. Example: `cafrun -n 4 ./program`, where `-n` defines 
the number of parallel processes.

## Hello World

As we already know the concept of an image is the center concept of coarrays. 
Each image runs in parallel until it completes, by doing so it works 
completely independently of other images.

There are two important built-in functions:
- `num_images()` - Gives the number of images that are being used
- `this_image()` - Returns the number of a specific image i.e. the index of 
the invoking image

The simplest example of these two functions:

```fortran
! test.f90
program main
  implicit none
  write (*,*) "Hello from image", this_image(), "of", num_images()
end program main
```

Compile this using `caf test.f90 -o a` and run it using `cafrun -n 4 ./a`. 
You'll see something like:

```text
Hello from image           2 of           4
Hello from image           4 of           4
Hello from image           3 of           4
Hello from image           1 of           4
```

Of course, this output depends on the number of images you've specified using 
`-n 4`.

## Number of images

If you are using unix-like system you can check the CPU information using 
`cat /proc/cpuinfo`. Depending on the number of your CPU cores the 
argument `-n X` can take different values.

In my case, using the docker image from above, I have 4 CPU cores. Running 
the code with a smaller number of images e.g. `cafrun -n 3` is completely 
fine but if I try a bigger number e.g. `cafrun -n 5`, I'll get an error 
stating:

```text
There are not enough slots available in the system to satisfy the 5
slots that were requested by the application:

  test

Either request fewer slots for your application, or make more slots
available for use.

A "slot" is the Open MPI term for an allocatable unit where we can
launch a process.  The number of slots available are defined by the
environment in which Open MPI processes are run:

  1. Hostfile, via "slots=N" clauses (N defaults to number of
     processor cores if not provided)
  2. The --host command line parameter, via a ":N" suffix on the
     hostname (N defaults to 1 if not provided)
  3. Resource manager (e.g., SLURM, PBS/Torque, LSF, etc.)
  4. If none of a hostfile, the --host command line parameter, or an
     RM is present, Open MPI defaults to the number of processor cores

In all the above cases, if you want Open MPI to default to the number
of hardware threads instead of the number of processor cores, use the
--use-hwthread-cpus option.

Alternatively, you can use the --oversubscribe option to ignore the
number of available slots when deciding the number of processes to
launch.
```

One of the ways to circumvent this is to use `--oversubscribe` which defines 
that the nodes are allowed to be oversubscribed, even on a managed system, 
and overloading of processing elements.

To pass this argument to `mpiexec` you can just add it to `cafrun` e.g. 
`cafrun -n 5 --oversubscribe ./test`.

## Synchronization

Synchronization is an image control statement. It is used to control the 
ordering of code execution on different images. In other words, all 
statements on independent images before synchronization must complete 
before images can continue with execution of the rest of the code.

A program that uses coarrays consists of one or more *execution segments*. 
Segments are separated by image control statements i.e. `sync` commands. If 
there are no `sync` statements in a program, then the program is executed in 
a single execution segment.

### sync all

The first image control statement that we will look at is `sync all`. It is 
used to synchronize the execution of all images. When execution on a single image 
reaches the `sync all` statement it waits for all images before all of them 
continue with the statements after `sync all`.

Better to illustrate it with an example. Let's say that we want two segments 
but we are executing the following code:

```fortran
program main
  implicit none
  write (*,*) "First segment executed on image", this_image()
  write (*,*) "Second segment executed on image", this_image()
end program main
```

This code is executed as a single execution segment and the output looks like:

```text
 First segment executed on image           2
 Second segment executed on image           2
 First segment executed on image           3
 Second segment executed on image           3
 First segment executed on image           4
 Second segment executed on image           4
 First segment executed on image           1
 Second segment executed on image           1
```

As you can see, the images are executed independently and there is 
no ordering of execution.

However, if we add `sync all` between `write` statements it will create 
two segments where all images have to complete the first segment before 
continuing to the second.

```fortran
program main
  implicit none
  write (*,*) "First segment executed on image", this_image()
  call execute_command_line('')
  sync all
  write (*,*) "Second segment executed on image", this_image()
  call execute_command_line('')
end program main
```

This output looks like:

```text
First segment executed on image           1
First segment executed on image           2
First segment executed on image           3
First segment executed on image           4
Second segment executed on image           2
Second segment executed on image           3
Second segment executed on image           4
Second segment executed on image           1
```

Please note the `call execute_command_line('')` statement, this is added due to 
the fact that information to `stdout` is buffered. Using this statement after 
the `write` causes the buffered information to be released. If you are interested 
in detailed discussion around this topic, please see: 
[Defect: "sync all" Doesn't Sync #693](https://github.com/sourceryinstitute/OpenCoarrays/issues/693){:target="_blank"} 
and 
[FLUSHing the standard output to impose order in Coarray applications](https://community.intel.com/t5/Intel-Fortran-Compiler/FLUSHing-the-standard-output-to-impose-order-in-Coarray/m-p/1143284){:target="_blank"}.

### sync images

Another image control statement is `sync images`, it gives us a way to 
synchronize between specific images. This statement takes a list of image 
indices. 

It's important to mention that if image X synchronizes with Y and Z then also 
Y and Z have to have `sync images` statements for X image:

```fortran
if (this_image() == 3) sync images( (/ 2, 4, 5 /) )
```

Here, image 3 waits for 2, 4, and 5. However, we also have to have 
corresponding statements:

```fortran
if (this_image() == 2) sync images(3)
if (this_image() == 4) sync images(3)
if (this_image() == 5) sync images(3)
```

If you want to synchronize a particular image `X` with all images but not with 
each other, you can use an asterisk:

```fortran
if (this_image() == X) sync images(*)
if (this_image() /= X) sync images(X)
```

Please check 
[Example - Swapping values between images](#swapping-values-between-images) 
to see `sync images` statement in action.

## Examples

### Read from an image

This example illustrates how we can set a value in one image and use it in 
others.

To achieve this we use `if(this_image() == 1)` to isolate the first image, 
set a value, then sync all images which secures that the value will be set 
before other images try to access it.

```fortran
program main
  implicit none
  integer :: i[*]
  if (this_image() == 1) then
    i = 100
    write (*,*) "First image", this_image(), "set value", i
    call execute_command_line('')
  end if
  sync all
  i = i[1]
  write (*,*) "Reading from image", this_image(), "value", i
  call execute_command_line('')
end program main
```

The output is:

```text
First image           1 set value         100
Reading from image           1 value         100
Reading from image           2 value         100
Reading from image           3 value         100
Reading from image           4 value         100
```

### Swapping values between images

This example perfectly demonstrates the use of local and remote data 
access, image isolation, and synchronization. 

The following code swaps values between the first and the last image:

```fortran
program main
  integer :: img, nimgs, i[*], tmp
  img = this_image()
  nimgs = num_images()
  i = img
  
  if (img == 1) then
    sync images(nimgs)
    tmp = i[nimgs]
    sync images(nimgs)
    i = tmp
  end if
  
  if (img == nimgs) then
    sync images(1)              
    tmp = i[1]
    sync images(1)
    i = tmp
  end if

  write (*,*) "Reading from image", img, "value", i
end program main
```

Which outputs:

```
Reading from image           3 value           3
Reading from image           4 value           1
Reading from image           1 value           4
Reading from image           2 value           2
```
