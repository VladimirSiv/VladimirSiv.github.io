Hey stranger :wave:

Thanks for visiting my blog, I really appreciate it!

I've started this site as an experiment, mainly to practice putting my work 
into plain language that readers of all fields could understand, but also as 
a chance to meet and connect with like-minded people.

Most of the articles here are related to data and 
programming but my plan is to occasionally write 
about the implementation of modern data solutions in 
scientific research.

I hope you will enjoy your stay and don't forget to grab 
a :coffee: before you start reading!

I am always available at <vladsiv@protonmail.com> :email:

### About Me

I earned my BSc in theoretical physics and MSc in biophysics.
Throughout my studies I was involved in several science projects that 
used large amounts of data to discover patterns and model phenomena.

After a brief academic career in the field of biophysics 
where I worked on developing new nonlinear model of 
microtubules I made a huge shift towards programming, data science, 
and cloud technologies.

My interests range from machine learning, data engineering to 
computational optimization, and high performance computing.

In my spare time I enjoy taking walks, learning new languages, 
drawing, and sometimes playing the guitar.
