### Abstract

In the present article we investigate the nonlinear dynamics of microtubules, 
the basic components of the eukaryotic cytoskeleton, relying on the known 
general model. We introduce the W-potential energy, describing a crucial 
interaction among constitutive particles within the microtubule. Three kinds 
of this potential are studied, one symmetrical and two non-symmetrical. We 
demonstrate an advantage of the latter ones. Solutions of crucial differential 
equations are solitary waves. The stability of the solutions having physical 
sense is studied. We show that only subsonic solitary waves are stable, while 
supersonic ones are not.

### Abstract

In this work, we study nonlinear dynamics of microtubules. An important 
interaction among constitutive particles is modeled using W-potential. We 
compare a symmetric potential with two kinds of non-symmetric ones. An 
advantage of the latter ones is demonstrated.

### Abstract

In the present work, we deal with nonlinear dynamics of microtubules. A new model, describing nonlinear dynamics of microtubules, is introduced. Its advantages over two existing models are demonstrated. We show that dynamics of microtubules can be explained in terms of kink solitons. Also, circumstances yielding to either subsonic or supersonic solitons are discussed.
