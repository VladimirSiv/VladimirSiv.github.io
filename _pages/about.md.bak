Hey stranger :wave:

Thanks for visiting my blog, I really appreciate it!

I've started this site as an experiment, mostly to practice 
putting my work into plain language that can be undestood by 
readers outside certain topics and fields, but also as a chance 
to meet and connect with like-minded people.

Most of the articles here are related to data and 
programming but my plan is to occasionally write 
about the interconnectedness between modern data solutions 
and science.

I hope you will enjoy your stay and don't forget to grab 
a :coffee: before you start reading!

I am always available at <vladsiv@protonmail.com> :email:

### About Me

I earned my BSc in theoretical physics and MSc in biophysics.
During my studies I got involved in several science projects that 
used large amount of data to discover patterns and model phenomena.

After a brief academic career in the field of biophysics 
where I've worked on developing new nonlinear model of 
microtubules I completely shifted to programming, data science, 
and cloud technologies.

My interests range from machine learning, data engineering to 
computational optimization, and high performance computing.

In my spare time I enjoy taking a walk, learning new languages, 
drawing, and sometimes playing the guitar.
